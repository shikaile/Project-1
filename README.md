<h2>Will You be Wearing your new Kicks out of the store? </h2>
<b> Deploy site:(https://shikaile.github.io/Project-1-Rock-or-Stock/) <b>
<p> This Project will help you seek out the release date of an upcoming shoe Release that you are intrested in.
The desired information to be captured will be an image of the shoe and its release date.
The project seeks to provide user with historical weather data from their selected city.
Once the desired city is selected the user can then search the shoe release date to check the historical weather.
If the weather is sunny a message will be sent to the user to let them know the shoe could be worn on the release date.

<ul>
   <li>We started off by getting together and communicating on what type of site we wanted to make.
   <li>once we choose a shoe site we noticed there might be an Api out there.
   <li>We went ahead and looked for a shoe API.
   <li>We noticed that we were able to do a varoius of customizations. 
   <li>Once we did this we knew we had to use Bulma As our CSS.
