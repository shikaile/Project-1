<h1>Rock or Stock</h1>
<h2>Will You be Wearing your new Kicks out of the store? </h2>
<b> Deploy site:(https://shikaile.github.io/Project-1-Rock-or-Stock/) <b>
<p> This Project will help you seek out the release date of an upcoming shoe Release that you are intrested in and give you the historical weather of that day. Once the city is selected the user can then search the shoe release date, to check the historical weather. If the weather is sunny a message will be sent to the user to let them know the shoe could be worn on the release date.

   <li>We went ahead and looked for a shoe API.
   <li>We noticed that we were able to do a varoius of customizations. 
   <li>Once we did this we knew we had to use Bulma As our CSS and JQUERY as our javascript
   <li>We went ahead and found a historical weather API
   <li>Once this was completed we choose a layout that we wanted
